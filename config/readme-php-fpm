QUICK SUGGESTION ABOUT PHP-FPM
==============================

The default settings for PHP will work fine and it's already pretty well optimised 
(it even uses Unix sockets rather than TCP to communicate with nginx), but from a 
security standpoint we can ensure that PHP's FPM module will only listen to nginx
(and therefore is less likely to be hacked) by typing:

    sudo nano /etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf

And un-commenting the lines listen.owner and listen.group. Save and exit the file.
